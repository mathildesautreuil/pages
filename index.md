  <h3> About me</h3>

  <br/>

I am currently working **Biomarker statistician** in the Boston area for Soladis Inc. (dba [EFOR group](https://efor-group.com/en/)), a consulting company specializing in life sciences (MedTech, Biotech, and the pharmaceutical industry). In my role, I support the Biomarker division within the Biomarker Statistics department at [Sanofi](https://www.sanofi.us/en/our-company).

In February 2022, I joined as **engineer** the [BU Omics](https://www.soladisomics.fr/) of [Soladis Group by Efor](https://www.soladis.com/). Soladis is a group specialized in managing projects around data, and the BU Omics handle the bioinformatics and biostatistics analysis of various field data. I work with [Servier](https://www.servier.fr/), a global pharmaceutical group. I aim to support the quantitative pharmacology department.

Before, I was a **research engineer** within the Statistics and genome of the [LaMME](http://www.math-evry.cnrs.fr/welcome){:target="\_blank"} at Evry University and the [Gnet team](https://ips2.u-psud.fr/en/research/pmin-department-plant-microbe-interactions-and-networks-biotic-interactions/gnet-genomics-networks/team-gnet-m-l-martin-magniette.html) of the IPS2 (Plant institute of Paris-Saclay). My research work consists to detect PPR footprints by using machine learning methods at Arabidopsis Thaliana.

Previously, I was a **PhD student** within the <a href = 'http://biomathematics.mics.centralesupelec.fr/en'>Biomathematics</a> team of the [MICS](http://mics.centralesupelec.fr/en/){:target="\_blank"} laboratory at CentraleSupélec (Paris-Saclay University) supervised by [Paul-Henry Cournède](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=fr&user=LGr1sroAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Sarah Lemler](https://sites.google.com/view/sarah-lemler). My research works focused on survival analysis and marker detection in Oncology. I use machine learning and statistical methods to predict the survival duration and detect the biomarkers in high-dimension.
                                        
I did an **two-year's apprenticeship** at both [LMRS](http://lmrs.univ-rouen.fr/){:target="\_blank"} (Laboratoire Mathématiques Raphaël Salem) and [LITIS](https://www.litislab.fr/accueil){:target="\_blank"} (Laboratoire d'Infomratique et traitement de l'information et des systèmes). My principle work was to develop mixture models bivariate Negative Binomiale for RNA-seq data. In addition, I developed an R package for the simulation and estimation of Markov and Semi-Markov models and a Shiny application for the processing of qRT-PCR data called [PROqPCR](https://qpcrapp.shinyapps.io/proqpcr/).
